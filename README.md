# js-flatten

js-flatten is utility designed to flatten nested JSON structures. Nested JSON can be challenging to work with and flattening the structure will give more simple view about the complex nested JSON. This could be used also to abstractify the complex JSON to more simple structure that is manageable by the user.

Features include:
* Recursive flattening âˆš
* Customizable separators
* Efficient and lightweight
* Easy integration

I practiced TDD with this small project.
